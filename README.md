## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

You sneak through a museum and identify valuable items. Once you're spotted, the heist begins and you have to steal as much as possible before time runs out.

## 🔁 Core Gameplay Loop

**1. Planning Phase**  
Sneak around the museum while avoiding security cameras. Identify high-value items and plan your route based on weight, fragility, and distance to the van.

**2. Execution Phase**  
Once you grab an item or get spotted, the countdown starts. Steal as much as you can, manage inventory space, and return to the van to unload.

**3. Extraction Phase**  
As the timer hits zero, the police arrive. If you’re not at the van in time, you lose everything.
